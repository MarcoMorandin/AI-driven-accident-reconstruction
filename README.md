## Navigating Legal and Ethical Boundaries in Insurance Claims Management
### Abstract
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in accident reconstruction presents significant opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of insurance claims management. This paper explores the legal and ethical challenges associated with AI-driven accident analysis, focusing on compliance with the European AI Act. AI technologies, including 3D simulations and data integration from various sources, can improve liability assessments and reduce litigation. However, these systems are classified as high-risk under the AI Act due to their potential influence on insurance decisions, requiring strict adherence to transparency, human oversight, and data governance principles. Ethical concerns such as bias in training data, lack of explainability, and privacy risks must be addressed to ensure fair and accountable AI implementation. To mitigate risks, we propose that AI systems be used as analytical tools that assist human experts rather than making liability determinations autonomously. This approach ensures compliance with legal requirements while maintaining trust and fairness in accident assessments.
